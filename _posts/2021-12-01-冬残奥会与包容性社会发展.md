history about [paralympic video](https://www.paralympic.org/ipc/history)

In 1944, at the request of the British Government, Dr. Ludwig Guttmann opened a spinal injuries centre at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Great Britain, and in time, rehabilitation sport evolved to recreational sport and then to competitive sport.

At first Guttmann took care of patients. 有些病人需要时常翻身，运动，避免感染。后来，他开始鼓励病人力所能及地去运动。



In 1948, Guttmann organized sports for veterans to get on moving again.

I'm really moved by the active spirit of these people with impairments.



## Question

how to call people with impairments politely

- handicapped
- crippled
- impairment
- disabled

> Avoid labeling persons and putting them in categories, as in *the handicapped, the disabled, the deaf, the retarded, the learning disabled*,and so on. Instead, use terminology such as: *a person who has multiple sclerosis, people with disabilities, a person with deafness*, and so on.
>
> Emphasize the individual *not the* disability. Rather than using terms such as *disabled person, handicapped people, a crippled person*, use terms such as *people/persons with disabilities, a person with a disability*, or *a person with a visual impairment*.

*Clearing* a *path* for *people* with Special *needs* Clears the *Path* for *everyone*
